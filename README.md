# FVTM Litepack Template


This Repository is a template for creating FVTM litepacks.    
You can just download it, and replace the IDs and naming accordingly to your future pack's needs.    
For reference check [the Wiki page](https://fexcraft.net/wiki/mod/fvtm/create-litepack).

You can also just place this 'pack-folder' into your ``/resourcepacks/`` or `/config/fvtm/packs` directory    
and it will work on next game launch! Make sure to set this _litepack resourcepack_ as active, so that textures do load.    
**Note:** You should use FVTM at least version 3.6.57 for this to load correctly.

### License
Aim of this repository is to give you a quick way to start an FVTM pack, it is free to use.    
The "cola.png" texture included in this is from the GEP pack, if you're gonna keep or modify it, leave credit.
